# faang-metadata

[Metadata and Data Sharing Committee (M&DS)](http://www.faang.org/)

The objective of the Metadata and Data Sharing committee is to recommend standard methods to record information for all samples, experiments and analyses carried out by FAANG consortium members; recommend best practice for data archiving; and define data sharing methodologies that encourage sharing within the FAANG consortium and rapid public release of raw data and analysis results.

The M&DS committee will meet monthly to discuss these issues and define and update the metadata standards

The expected outcomes are:
Metadata standard documents to assist FAANG members to define sample, experimental and analysis metadata. These documents will highlight both required fields and recommended additional info.
A guidance document for archive submission of sample records and experimental and analysis data.
Data sharing facilities for both within consortium sharing and public release.
Work with the Analysis and Samples/Assays committees to ensure the metadata and data sharing standards meet the scientific needs of FAANG.
Contribute to organised scientific dissemination to the whole community.
